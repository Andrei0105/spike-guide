# Resources
Here's a quick list of resources that I've personally found very helpful along the way. It's by no means extensive, and I'll add to it as I find things.

## Git

* The [Git website](https://git-scm.com/)

* The [Progit free e-book](https://github.com/progit/progit2/releases/download/2.1.146/progit.pdf). Careful with this one, it's a 500-something page PDF. It's the most extensive guide you'll ever find, but a hefty download if you've got a slow internet connection. You can also find [an online version here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) if you don't want to download it.

## GitHub

* The [GitHub website](https://guides.github.com/)

## Swift

The [Swift website](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)

## Building apps
I'm personally still looking for other good resources available on this, but the YouTube channel [Code With Chris](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D6eRvCeMtcF5OGHf1-trw) has been really fantastic for me so far. He has lots of tutorials, from building apps in Xcode to learning Swift.
